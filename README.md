The old version of (GeoLib)[https://github.com/Kylerace/GeoLib]. Main current difference is that it doesn't allow for reordering multivector elements and more behavior is coupled to the multivector type.

To run, enter "zig build run" in command line and it will run the basic geometric product example in main().
